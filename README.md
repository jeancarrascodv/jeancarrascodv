# Jean Carrasco (jeancarrascodv)
For years, I optimized industrial processes as an engineer. Now, I'm applying that problem-solving mindset to create efficient and scalable back-end and cloud solutions. I'm currently finalizing my Software Engineering studies at a university in Utah USA, and I'm proficient in a wide range of technologies, including React, Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, Java, Maven, Rust, AWS, and various databases.

Let's connect and explore how my unique blend of skills can propel your ventures forward.
